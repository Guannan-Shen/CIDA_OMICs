**Guannan Shen**  
**Instructor: Katerina Kechris**

## Methods
### Samples
Sample GSM3374613: **Original single cell RNA-seq library** from the 10x genomics 3' end library prep. PBMCs were isolated from a health human donor.  

Sample GSM3374614: ***Resampled* single cell RNA-seq library** from the 10x genomics 3' end library prep. PBMCs were isolated from a health human donor and a LNA probe was used to hybridize selected cells for targeted resequencing.
